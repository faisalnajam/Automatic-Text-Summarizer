# Automatic-Text-Summarizer
Automated Text Summarization using Cosine Similarity and PageRank Algorithm

This project provides a Python implementation of text summarization using cosine similarity. The program reads in text files from a folder, generates a summary for each file, and outputs the summaries to a Pandas dataframe.

Requirements

    Python 3.6+
    Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab

Installation

    Clone the repository or download the files as a zip.
    Open the project directory in Jupyter Notebook or Google Colab.
    Run the code in the notebook.

Usage

    Save text files to a folder and set the path to 'folder_path'.
    Run the summarize_files_in_folder function to generate summaries for all text files in the folder.
    Run the grade_summaries function to prompt the user to enter a grade for each summary.
    Run the Data Visualization Block to generate a bar plot of the summary grades.

Video

A demo of the project can be found here in Video file. The demo shows how to use the program to generate summaries for text files and visualize the results.

Data Used

The Text_Summarization_Files folder contains sample summaries that were randomly generated. These can be used to implement the code.
